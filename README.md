# How to unsuck the use of Options in Futures

This is an implementation of the excellent [talk]() by Erik Bakker about **Options in Futures, how to unsuck them
**.

The intention is to give a starting point, so that you can play around with it.

I have implemented Part 1-3, but not 4 (the discussion on how to use this to clean up your Play code).

Erik obviously also has [his own code/tutorial/repo](https://github.com/eamelink/flatten) on the [topic](https://speakerdeck.com/eamelink/flatten-your-code).

How to make it work ...

* clone the repo
* run `sbt "run 1 2"`
* have fun :) ...
